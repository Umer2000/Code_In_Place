🧠 About the Project
I built Pixel Painter to explore tkinter, custom UI event handling, and graphics in Python. It was a hands-on way to implement real tools like undo/redo stacks, file I/O for images, and creative UX with drawing and erasing logic. This project helped me practice structured design and interactive programming in a fun way!
